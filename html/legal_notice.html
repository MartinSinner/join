        <p><strong>Liability for Content</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The content of our pages was created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service provider,
          we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 para.1 DDG under general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated as a service
          provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use
          of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon
          becoming aware of such violations, we will remove this content immediately.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Liability for Links</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, on whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents.
          The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at
          the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. Permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is, however, unreasonable
          without concrete evidence of a violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
        </p>
        <br />

          The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of
          exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for
          private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this page was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular,
          third-party content is marked as such. Should you still become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for a corresponding notice. Upon becoming aware of legal
          violations, we will remove such content immediately.

        <p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (for example, name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our
          pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. These data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent. <br />
          We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is
          not possible. <br />
          The use of contact data published as part of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly
          prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the case of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam
          emails.
