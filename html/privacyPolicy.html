        <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below, you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, 
          in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence or business location may also apply. If more specific 
          legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of them in our privacy policy.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose or multiple specified purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> 
            - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> 
            - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject requiring protection of personal data do not override those interests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the 
          Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG), which provides specific regulations on the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing 
          of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, data transfers, and automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Additionally, data protection 
          laws of individual federal states may also apply.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Austria: </strong>In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Austria. This includes, in particular, 
          the Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons in the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act – DSG). The Data Protection Act contains specific provisions on the 
          right of access, the right to rectification or erasure, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, data transfers, and automated 
          individual decision-making.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Relevant legal bases under the Swiss Data Protection Act: </strong>If you are located in Switzerland, we process your data based on the Federal Act on Data Protection 
          (Swiss FADP). Unlike the GDPR, the Swiss FADP generally does not require a legal basis to be specified for data processing. Instead, personal data must be processed in good 
          faith, lawfully, and proportionately (Art. 6(1) and (2) Swiss FADP). Additionally, personal data is only collected for a specific, recognizable purpose for the data subject and 
          is processed only in a way that is compatible with that purpose (Art. 6(3) Swiss FADP).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Note on applicability of GDPR and Swiss FADP: </strong>These privacy notices serve to provide information under both the Swiss FADP and the GDPR. For broader applicability 
          and ease of understanding, the terminology of the GDPR is used. Specifically, instead of the terms used in the Swiss FADP, such as “processing” of “personal data,” “overriding 
          interest,” and “particularly sensitive personal data,” the GDPR terms “processing” of “personal data,” “legitimate interest,” and “special categories of data” are used. However, 
          the legal meaning of the terms remains defined by the Swiss FADP within its scope of application.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, considering the state of the art, implementation costs, 
          the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of threats to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, 
          to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, 
          as well as access, input, transmission, availability security, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures that allow for the exercise of 
          data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. Additionally, we consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection 
          of hardware, software, and procedures, following the principles of data protection by design and by default.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          In the course of processing personal data, we may transfer or disclose such data to other entities, companies, legally independent organizations, or individuals. 
          Recipients of this data may include service providers responsible for IT-related tasks or providers of services and content integrated into a website. In such cases, 
          we comply with legal requirements and conclude contracts or agreements with the recipients to protect your data.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Data processing in third countries:</strong> If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) 
          or if processing occurs in the context of using third-party services or disclosing or transferring data to other entities, persons, or companies, this is done only in 
          accordance with legal requirements. If an adequacy decision has been issued for the third country (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. 
          Otherwise, data transfers only take place if an adequate level of data protection is ensured in other ways, particularly through standard contractual clauses 
          (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in cases of contractual or legally required transfers (Art. 49(1) GDPR). In addition, we inform you about the legal basis 
          for third-country transfers in relation to individual third-country providers, with adequacy decisions taking precedence. 
          Information on third-country transfers and applicable adequacy decisions can be found on the European Commission's website:
          <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de" target="_blank">
            https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de
          </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the level of data protection for certain U.S. companies as adequate under its 
          adequacy decision of 07/10/2023. The list of certified companies and further information about the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce website:
          <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>.
          Our privacy notices inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Disclosure of personal data abroad:</strong> According to the Swiss Data Protection Act (Swiss FADP), we only transfer personal data abroad if adequate protection 
          for the affected persons is ensured (Art. 16 Swiss FADP). If the Swiss Federal Council has not recognized adequate protection 
          (list: <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/en/home/state/data-protection/international/recognition-of-states.html" target="_blank">
            https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/en/home/state/data-protection/international/recognition-of-states.html</a>), 
          we implement alternative security measures. These may include international treaties, specific guarantees, data protection clauses in contracts, standard 
          data protection clauses approved by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), or company-internal data protection regulations 
          recognized by the FDPIC or another competent data protection authority. 
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Art. 16 of the Swiss FADP, exceptions for international data transfers may be granted under certain conditions, 
          such as the consent of the data subject, contract fulfillment, public interest, protection of life or physical integrity, 
          publicly available data, or data from legally mandated registers. Such disclosures always comply with legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), Switzerland has also recognized the data protection level for certain U.S. companies as adequate under its adequacy 
          decision of 06/07/2024. The list of certified companies and further details about the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce website:
          <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>.
          Our privacy notices inform you about which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the underlying consent is revoked or 
          no other legal basis for processing exists. This applies when the original purpose of processing is no longer applicable or 
          the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist when legal obligations or particular interests require extended retention or archiving of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons or that is necessary for legal prosecution or the 
          protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our privacy notices include additional information about data retention and deletion policies that apply specifically to certain 
          processing operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          If multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines apply to a piece of data, the longest period is always authoritative.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a retention period does not explicitly begin on a specified date and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of 
          the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurs. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships where data is stored, 
          the event triggering the retention period is the date the termination or other legal conclusion of the contractual relationship takes effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data that is no longer required for its original purpose but must be retained due to legal obligations or other reasons is processed 
          only for the purposes justifying its retention.

        <p>
          The term "cookies" refers to features that store information on the user's devices and retrieve it. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, such as functionality, security, and comfort of online services, as well as for creating analysis of visitor flows. We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. For this purpose, we obtain the user's consent in advance if necessary. If consent is not required, we rely on our legitimate interests. This applies when storing and retrieving information is essential to provide explicitly requested content and functions. This includes, for example, saving settings and ensuring the functionality and security of our online services. Consent can be revoked at any time. We clearly inform about the scope and which cookies are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes on Data Protection Legal Basis:</strong> Whether we process personal data using cookies depends on consent. If consent is given, it serves as the legal basis. Without consent, we rely on our legitimate interests, which are explained earlier in this section and in the context of the respective services and processes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Storage Duration:</strong> Regarding storage duration, the following types of cookies are distinguished:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Temporary Cookies (also: Session or Session Cookies):</strong>
            Temporary cookies are deleted as soon as a user leaves an online service and closes their device (e.g., browser or mobile application).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Permanent Cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved, and preferred content can be directly displayed when the user visits a website again. Similarly, user data collected via cookies may be used for reach measurement. If we do not provide explicit information about the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., during the collection of consent), users should assume that these cookies are permanent and can be stored for up to two years.
          </li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Processing of Cookie Data Based on Consent:</strong> We use a consent management solution to obtain users' consent for the use of cookies or for the procedures and providers mentioned in the consent management solution. This procedure is used to collect, log, manage, and withdraw consent, particularly regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies that are used to store, read, and process information on the user's devices. As part of this procedure, users' consent for the use of cookies and the associated processing of information, including the specific processes and providers mentioned in the consent management process, is obtained. Users also have the option to manage and withdraw their consent. The consent declarations are stored to avoid asking for consent again and to be able to provide proof of consent in accordance with legal requirements. The storage is done server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie) or using similar technologies to associate the consent with a specific user or their device. If no specific information about consent management service providers is available, the following general information applies: The duration of consent storage is up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created, which is stored along with the time of consent, the scope of the consent (e.g., relevant categories of cookies and/or service providers), and information about the browser, system, and device used;

        <h2 id="m263">Web Analysis, Monitoring, and Optimization</h2>
        <p>
          Web analysis (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the visitor traffic to our online services and can include behavior, interests, or demographic information about the visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous data. With the help of reach analysis, we can, for example, identify when our online services or their functions or content are used most frequently or when a revisit is likely. It also allows us to understand which areas need optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to web analysis, we may also use testing procedures to test and optimize different versions of our online services or their components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless stated otherwise below, profiles, which are data grouped together for a usage process, may be created, and information can be stored in a browser or on a device and then read. The data collected includes visited websites and used elements, as well as technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used, and information about usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data with us or with the providers of the services we use, location data may also be processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the IP addresses of users are stored. However, we use an IP masking process (i.e., pseudonymization by truncating the IP address) to protect users. Generally, no clear user data (e.g., email addresses or names) is stored as part of web analysis, A/B testing, and optimization, but pseudonyms are used. This means that neither we nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the specific procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information on legal bases: If we ask users for their consent to use third-party services, the legal basis for the data processing is consent. Otherwise, user data is processed based on our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in efficient, economical, and user-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information regarding the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

            <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to measure and analyze the usage of our online services based on a pseudonymous user identification number. This identification number does not contain any unique data, such as names or email addresses. It is used to assign analytical data to a device in order to recognize which content users have accessed within a single or multiple sessions, which search terms they have used, re-accessed, or interacted with our online services. Additionally, the time of use and its duration are stored, as well as the sources that refer users to our online services and technical aspects of their devices and browsers.<br /> Pseudonymous user profiles are created using information from the use of different devices, with cookies potentially being used. Google Analytics does not log or store individual IP addresses for EU users. However, Analytics provides rough geographical location data by deriving the following metadata from IP addresses: city (and the derived latitude and longitude of the city), continent, country, region, subcontinent (and ID-based counterparts). For EU traffic, IP address data is only used for the derivation of geolocation data and is immediately deleted thereafter. They are not logged, are not accessible, and are not used for other purposes. When Google Analytics collects measurement data, all IP queries are carried out on EU-based servers before the traffic is forwarded to Analytics servers for processing; <strong>Service Provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=""><strong>Legal Bases:</strong> Consent (Art. 6(1) Sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong>

          The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the users' IP addresses, as they cannot send the content to the users' browsers without the IP address. The IP address is thus necessary for the display of these contents or functions. We strive to only use content whose respective providers apply the IP address solely for delivering the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. Through "pixel tags," information such as the visitor traffic on the pages of this website can be evaluated. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the users' devices and may contain technical details such as the browser and operating system used, referring websites, visit times, and further details about the usage of our online services, but can also be combined with such information from other sources.

            <strong>Google Fonts (Sourced from Google Server):</strong> Fonts (and symbols) are sourced for the purpose of technically secure, maintenance-free, and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to currentness and load times, uniform display, and consideration of possible copyright restrictions. The font provider receives the user's IP address to make the fonts available in the user's browser. Additionally, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, used hardware) are transmitted, which are necessary for providing the fonts depending on the devices and technical environment used. This data may be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online services, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides the users with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) from Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CSS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to access the internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the User-Agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referring URL (i.e., the website on which the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers, and they are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, User-Agent, and referring URL). Access to this data is restricted and tightly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a specific font family is requested. The User-Agent is primarily logged for debugging and used to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These summarized usage statistics are published on the "Analytics" page of Google Fonts. Finally, the referring URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and an aggregated report of top integrations based on the number of font requests can be generated. According to Google, none of the data collected by Google Fonts is used to create user profiles or display targeted ads; <strong>Service Provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=""><strong>Legal Bases:</strong> Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1) Sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong>
